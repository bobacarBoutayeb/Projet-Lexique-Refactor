      Carried by a team of developers from Lyon, France, Lexique is a tool that sprung from the group projects of the Wild Code School.
      Made entirely within three weeks, this tool allows a user to make and change their own dictionaries, to help with learning or keeping track of notions.
      User-friendly and open, Lexique will prove ideal for the acquisition of technical language, for the learning of foreign languages, and even as a personal wiki for creative endeavors.
